# Abstract:
Gastrointestinal diseases are widespread among humans and pose a major healthcare challenge.
Many disorders within the gastrointestinal tract, such as obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, ul-
cer infections, and both benign and malignant tumors, can develop without obvious symptoms.
If left untreated, these conditions can progress to gastrointestinal cancer. Traditionally, endo-
scopic examination is used to diagnose these gastrointestinal diseases, with specific anatom-
ical landmarks guiding gastroenterologists during the procedure to ensure a thorough exami-
nation. Automated detection of anatomical abnormalities in endoscopic images is crucial for
assisting clinical assessments and streamlining the time and cost associated with gastrointesti-
nal tract screening. This study introduced an innovative Convolutional Block Attention Mod-
ule (CBAM) based deep learning approach for identifying anatomical landmarks in the gas-
trointestinal (GI) tract. The newly developed architectural framework was evaluated using the
anatomical landmarks of the Kvasir-V2 dataset. Integrating CBAM with CNN in this research
led to a groundbreaking improvement, significantly enhancing accuracy and efficiency in iden-
tifying complex gastrointestinal anatomical landmarks. The proposed method achieved an im-
pressive accuracy of 99.1% in identifying anatomical anomalies. This CBAM-based deep learn-
ing approach surpassed other state-of-the-art studies in gastrointestinal classification, demon-
strating remarkable superiority in both accuracy and efficien
